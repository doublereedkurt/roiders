Dependencies: 
Panda3d 1.8+ (for 3D rendering)
numpy (for game physics)
WxPython (for 2D UI)

WxPython does not seem to play nice with Panda3D;
need to run with system python instead of Panda3D bundled python;
this requires a panda.pth file in the Python27 directory

Contents of panda.pth file is simply 2 lines:
C:\Panda3D-1.8.0 
C:\Panda3D-1.8.0\bin

This allows Panda3D to run from system Python.
(PYTHONPATH variable should automatically be updated with Panda3D libraries
by Panda3D installer)
