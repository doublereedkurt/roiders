There are a lot of dependencies:

For rendering:
I -- Panda3D version 1.7+
For finite element analysis (i.e. heat/gas flow, radiation):
II -- numpy, scipy, pysparse; these all have C/C++ components;
google and download pre-compiled versions, trying to compile them is just pain
III -- fipy -- pure python finite element library (has numpy+scipy+pysparse dependencies)


Some issues with getting finite element simulation library working:

1- pysparse library failed to import DLL's
(manifested as itsolvers DLL failing to import)
to fix this, use dependency walker, load the PYD file and see what dependencies
are missing
  A) ieshims.dll missing; solution: add "%ProgramFiles%\Internet Explorer" to Path
  B) libiomp5.dll missnig; this is an OpenMP library; this was added to the roiders directory
